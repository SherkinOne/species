Species Checker

This is too check that species exist in relative to databases.
Terrestial species are checked against the global diversity database, where as the
marine species are checked against the WORMS database.

The file must be of XLSX format, and from this you can choose your sheet.

The input data must be stored in the first column of the sheet, and the return will 
give, if needed, the accepted name in the second column, with the phyla in the third column.

If no relative spieces is found an error will be returned.  The input species should be displayed
in full name, and any spelt correctly.

An empty cell is used to denote the end of the file.
